Left game randomly pushes the ball every 1.5 seconds
Middle game pushes the ball towards the pins once, at the start of the simulation
Right game chooses a direction based on the "arrow". Once the ball is clicked, the force to be applied keeps increasing, up to a cap. When the mouse is released, the force is applied in the direction of the arrow.
